# Dark Boruto Rainmeter Skin

My first rainmeter skin with dark and light blue colors.
The skin was built and tested using Rainmeter version 4.3.1. You can download the latest version of Rainmeter from Rainmeter.net. The RMSKIN installer package for the skin can be downloaded from GitHub releases.

### How-To ###

Just click on it, after you installed Rainmeter and it will install and load itself.
